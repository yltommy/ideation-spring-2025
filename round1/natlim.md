## Problem Statement

Recipe websites are notorious for being cluttered with lengthy personal stories, excessive advertisements, and inconsistent formatting, making it difficult for users to quickly find the information they need. Additionally, valuable insights from user comments and potential ingredient substitutions are often buried or scattered across the page. Mise En Place solves these problems by extracting and standardizing recipe content, highlighting user-recommended modifications, suggesting ingredient substitutions, and providing easy shopping list exports.

## Target Audience

Home cooks and food enthusiasts who regularly use online recipes but are frustrated by the current browsing experience. The primary audience includes busy students or professionals, parents, and culinary hobbyists who value efficiency, organization, and flexibility in their cooking process. They are digitally savvy enough to use browser extensions but want a simplified cooking experience.

## Description

Mise En Place (French for "everything in its place") is a Chrome extension that transforms cluttered recipe websites into clean, standardized formats while extracting useful information like top-rated user modifications and ingredient substitutions. Just as professional chefs organize all ingredients before cooking, Mise En Place organizes recipe information efficiently and effectively before the user begins cooking.
