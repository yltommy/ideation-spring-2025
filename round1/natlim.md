## Problem Statement

Recipe websites are notorious for being cluttered with lengthy personal stories, excessive advertisements, and inconsistent formatting, making it difficult for users to quickly find the information they need. Additionally, valuable insights from user comments and potential ingredient substitutions are often buried or scattered across the page. Mise En Place solves these problems by extracting and standardizing recipe content, highlighting user-recommended modifications, suggesting ingredient substitutions, and providing easy shopping list exports.

## Target Audience

Home cooks and food enthusiasts who regularly use online recipes but are frustrated by the current browsing experience. The primary audience includes busy students or professionals, parents, and culinary hobbyists who value efficiency, organization, and flexibility in their cooking process. They are digitally savvy enough to use browser extensions but want a simplified cooking experience.

## Description

Mise En Place (French for "everything in its place") is a Chrome extension that transforms cluttered recipe websites into clean, standardized formats while extracting useful information like top-rated user modifications and ingredient substitutions. Just as professional chefs organize all ingredients before cooking, Mise En Place organizes recipe information efficiently and effectively before the user begins cooking.

## Selling Points

1. Clean Interface: Instantly removes ads, life stories, and distractions to display only the essential recipe content in a standardized format.
2. Comment Intelligence: Analyzes and highlights the most helpful user comments and suggested modifications from the original recipe page.
3. Smart Substitutions: Suggests ingredient alternatives based on dietary restrictions, preferences, or what users have on hand.
4. Simplified Shopping: Extracts ingredient lists and allows easy export to shopping lists or grocery delivery services.
5. Universal Format: Creates consistency across various recipe websites, providing the same user-friendly experience regardless of the original source.

## User Stories

1. As a busy home cook, I want to view recipes without scrolling through long stories and ads so that I can quickly access cooking instructions.
2. As a recipe user, I want to see the most helpful user comments and modifications so that I can improve the recipe based on others' experiences.
3. As someone with dietary restrictions, I want to easily find ingredient substitutions so that I can adapt recipes to my needs.
4. As a meal planner, I want to export ingredient lists to my shopping app so that I can efficiently prepare for grocery shopping.
5. As a frequent recipe browser, I want consistent formatting across different recipe websites so that I can easily find information regardless of the source.

## Notes
Implementation challenges include developing algorithms to extract recipe content from diverse website layouts, analyzing comment sections for valuable insights, and ensuring cross-site compatibility. 

Mise En Place will ideally contain the following features:

Clean Interface:
* Transforms cluttered pages into a consistent format with clear sections
* Toggle between original page and clean version with a single click
* Print-friendly mode optimized for cooking reference

* Scaling option based on desired servings

Extracted User Recommendations:

The name "Mise En Place" reflects the extension's purpose: just as chefs organize ingredients before cooking, this extension organizes recipe information before the user starts cooking.
