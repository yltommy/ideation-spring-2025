# Chrome Extension Idea: Recipe Extractor

## Authors

## Problem Statement

This Chrome Extension will make it easier to extract the actual recipe content from cooking recipe websites. When users visit one of these websites, they almost always have a slew of backstories, advertisements, and other things not related to the recipe at all, which makes it difficult to navigate and find the actual recipe. The unnecessary content also sometimes makes the webpage laggier. This extension addresses these pain points by filtering out all unnecessary content.

## Target Audience

The main target audience is home cooks who like to follow recipes online, especially older people who may have trouble navigating through all the clutter of these recipe websites. This audience may be very busy and not have the time to have to scroll all the way through a bunch of unrelated text just to find the recipe (for example, moms who are cooking for their children).

## Description

The main purpose of the Chrome Extension is to filter out all text and advertisements unrelated to the recipe. It will parse the recipe from the website and remove all unrelated content, only displaying the final recipe on the webpage for the viewer. It may also have an option to copy the contents of the recipe to the clipboard.

## Selling Points

1. Faster to find recipes
2. Makes webpages less laggy
3. Removes unrelated content from page
4. Makes it easier to copy recipes
5. Makes it easier to navigate the page

## User Stories

As a home cook, I want to be able to remove all unrelated content from the recipe so that I do not have to scroll through the whole webpage.

As a busy parent, I want to quickly find the ingredient list and cooking steps without wading through stories and ads so that I can start cooking immediately.

As an older person with vision issues, I want a cleaner interface with only essential recipe information so that I can easily read the instructions.

As someone with a slow internet connection, I want to load only the recipe content so that webpages load faster and use less data.

As a meal planner, I want to easily copy recipe ingredients to my shopping list so that I can efficiently prepare for grocery shopping.

## Notes

Potential challenges:

- Recipe websites use various formats and structures, making automatic extraction complex
- Some sites may use anti-scraping techniques
- Keeping the extension updated as website structures change
