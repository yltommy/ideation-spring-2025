# Chrome Extension Idea: StudySync 

## Authors

## Problem Statement

Students often miss deadlines or cram last-minute because Canvas doesn’t offer personalized study planning or adaptive task scheduling. 
While Canvas provides due dates, it lacks features to help students organize their time based on workload, exam dates, and ongoing tasks. 
This extension bridges that gap by transforming Canvas data into a visual study plan that students can easily follow to stay on top of their work.

## Target Audience

The target audience is college and high school students who use Canvas as their learning management system. 
These students are juggling multiple assignments, exams, and class schedules and want a way to stay ahead without manually tracking everything.

## Description

This chrome extension pulls data from Canvas (assignments, quizzes, exams, todo), inputs into ChatGPT/another LLM and generates a personalized study schedule. 
User can enter specific prompts such as "I have a tennis tournament this weekend and will be out of town, here is a list of my upcoming assignments: give me a 
schedule that breaks down what I should complete first". It breaks down tasks by priority and deadline, suggests ideal study blocks and flag upcoming tests with extra prep time while keeping students
organized in real life.

## Selling Points

1. Seamlessly works with Canvas to extract assignments, due dates, and exams
2. Converts deadlines into manageable daily study blocks
3. Automatically builds in prep time for midterms, finals, and projects
4. Displays tasks for the rest of the week/month in a timeline view to help students stay on track
5. Works in browser without having to copy and paste information in ChatGPT

## User Stories

As a student, I want the extension to pull all my upcoming Canvas deadlines so I can see everything in one view.

As a student, I want study sessions scheduled before exams so I can be better prepared.

As a student, I want the extension to highlight assignments due soon so I don’t forget them.

As a student, I want to view my weekly tasks in a calendar format so I can plan my days better.

As a student, I want the extension to update my study plan automatically if due dates change on Canvas.

## Notes
Some challenges may include requiring Canvas API tokens or login access. In addition, some professors do not post homework deadlines on Canvas and prefer Gradescope,
so may be difficult to get a full grasp of a student's schedule.
