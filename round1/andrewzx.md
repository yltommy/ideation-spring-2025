# Chrome Extension Idea: Round 1

## Authors

## Problem Statement

News can often feel overwhelming or emotionally draining. On particularly tough days, readers may crave content that lifts their spirits or want to avoid news topics that are personally triggering.

## Target Audience

People who read the news online -- students, working professionals and other casual readers, generally between 20-60 years of age. 

## Description

The main functionality is that this Chrome Extension can extract all the headlines and subheadlines from a particular newspaper website and then paste them into ChatGPT. The user can select to filter by emotion (5 options: inspiring, funny, uplifting, depressing, nerve-wracking) and filter out certain trigger words (maximum 3) on the extension window. When the extension is triggered, ChatGPT will extract all the articles on the website, analyze the content, and output the headlines, subheadlines and the link to the articles that pass the filters. 

## Selling Points

1. Enables emotionally-aware news consumption.
2. Customizable to suit daily moods or preferences.
3. Saves time by filtering out undesired content upfront.
4. Accessible, lightweight, and free Chrome Extension.

## User Stories

1. As a stressed-out student, I want to see only uplifting news articles so that I can feel more motivated and less anxious while catching up on current events.
2. As a working professional, I want to filter out news containing certain trigger words (e.g., “violence,” “war”) so that I can focus on the news that won’t affect my mental well-being during a busy day.
3. As a casual reader, I want to extract all headlines from a news site in one click so that I don’t have to scroll through cluttered websites to find interesting stories.
4. As an emotionally sensitive user, I want to sort news by emotional tone (e.g., happy, hopeful, neutral) so that I can control how I feel after reading the news.
5. As a tech-savvy user, I want to customize the emotional filter and trigger word list so that the extension tailors news recommendations to my personal preferences.

## Notes

Potential Challenges
1. Different news sites might have different ways of formatting their HTML script, so we will need to decide on whether to tailor the extension code to a specific site or make it such that it will work for multiple sites.
2. It might be hard to judge a news article based on purely its headline and sub-headline, since news companies tend to phrase their headlines in a way that favors their own marketing efforts and lures people to click on them even if they do not reflect the actual content.

## References & Inspiration

I was partially inspired by HW2 Daily Pennsylvanian scraper but also from personal experience since I feel that recent news have been stressful and depressing, and sometimes I just want to read news that can make me smile.
