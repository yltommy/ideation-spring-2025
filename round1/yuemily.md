## Problem Statement

Students often struggle to keep track of their assignments, due dates, and weekly workload across multiple Canvas course pages. This leads to inefficiencies, 
missed deadlines, and the need to keep numerous tabs open to check each class individually. Our Chrome extension solves this problem by automatically extracting and 
summarizing Canvas data—such as assignments, quizzes, and announcements—into a weekly overview or calendar format. 

## Target Audience

The primary target audience is students who use Canvas as their learning management system. 

## Description

Canvas Data Extractor is a Chrome Extension designed to automatically pull assignment data from a user's Canvas dashboard and generate a clear, summarized view of 
weekly tasks. It can also populate a calendar and send optional reminders to help users stay on top of their academic responsibilities.

## Selling Points
