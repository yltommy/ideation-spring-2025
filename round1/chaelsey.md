# Chrome Extension Idea: Apollo AutoMailer

## Authors

Chaelsey Park

## Problem Statement

People who use Apollo to collect emails from LinkedIn often have to export those emails to a spreadsheet, write semi-personalized outreach messages, and then mass-send them using external tools. This process is slow and inefficient.

## Target Audience

Salespeople, recruiters, founders, and marketers who actively look for candidates through LinkedIn and utilize Apollo to collect emails.

## Description

This is a Chrome extension integrated with LinkedIn and Apollo to automate cold email outreach. Once a user collects an email via Apollo, they can instantly create a personalized email (using LLM) in a single click. 

## Selling Points

1. Instantly send personalized emails from LinkedIn (no spreadsheets necessary).
2. LLM-generated messages will feel more personalized, improving response rates.
3. Streamline Apollo and LinkedIn workflow into a single, efficient user experience.
4. Users will still be able to define tone and format of the emails.
5. Saves lots of time for salespeople and recruiters.

## User Stories

1. As a salesperson, I want to click a button next to a lead's profile to instantly send a custom email so that I can save time on manual outreach.

2. As a recruiter, I want the email to reflect the candidateâ€™s background and role so that the message feels personal and relevant.

3. As a user, I want to pre-set my email format and tone so that every message follows my style while still sounding personalized.

4. As a founder, I want to outreach leads from LinkedIn quickly without leaving the platform so that I can move faster.

5. As a marketer, I want to test different message templates so that I can learn what gets better engagement.


## Notes

- LinkedIn restrictions
- Create drafts if sending is restricted
- Potential goals: add analytics (open rates, response rates)
