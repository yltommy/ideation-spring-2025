# Chrome Extension Idea: LeetGPT

## Authors

## Problem Statement

LeetCode users often face challenges in quickly identifying logical errors, optimizing code, or understanding complex algorithm problems. While coding, users may want instant feedback to improve their solutions but don't have an easy way to get structured feedback without leaving the platform. Manually copying and pasting code into a separate tool or asking for feedback is time-consuming. The extension addresses these pain points by providing automated feedback directly from GPT without needing to leave the LeetCode environment.

## Target Audience

Primary Audience: Developers and coders using LeetCode for learning, practice, or interview preparation.

Secondary Audience: Students, professionals, and anyone preparing for technical coding interviews or looking for coding solutions and feedback in real time.

Characteristics: Tech-savvy, primarily working with coding platforms, eager to improve coding skills or problem-solving abilities, and looking for efficient, time-saving tools to enhance their coding workflow.

## Description

LeetGPT is a Chrome extension designed to provide real-time, AI-powered feedback on code written within the LeetCode editor. By extracting the code and problem description directly from LeetCode, users can toggle the type of feedback they want (e.g., bug detection, optimization suggestions, code explanation, etc.) and receive GPT-generated feedback with the click of a button — all without ever leaving the platform.

## Selling Points

Instant Code Feedback: Get real-time analysis and suggestions without leaving the LeetCode editor.

Personalized Feedback Options: Choose the type of feedback you want — from bug detection to alternative solutions — all customized based on the user’s needs.

Seamless Integration: Automatically extract code and problem data from LeetCode, making the feedback process simple and efficient.

Multi-language Support: Supports various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.), adjusting feedback based on the code's language.

User History & Saved Sessions: Save and revisit previous queries and feedback to track your progress over time.

## User Stories
As a developer, I want to receive detailed feedback on my code directly from GPT, so that I can improve it without leaving the LeetCode editor.

As a student, I want to choose the type of feedback I receive (e.g., bug detection, performance optimization), so that I can get targeted advice based on my current needs.

As a coder preparing for interviews, I want to receive suggestions for edge cases and test cases, so that I can ensure my solution works under all conditions.

As a beginner, I want to have a simple, clean interface that doesn’t distract me from my coding task, so that I can focus on coding and improving my skills.

As a user, I want to be able to save and review my past feedback, so that I can track my improvement over time.

## Notes
Challenges: Maintaining a lightweight extension while processing large code inputs might be a challenge. Efficient handling of large code blocks and GPT API token limits should be prioritized.

Alternative Approach: If the LeetCode API allows, consider directly integrating GPT feedback within the LeetCode interface, instead of a Chrome extension.

Feature Priority: Focus on core features like feedback generation and seamless code extraction first, then move on to the more complex features like user history or advanced settings.
